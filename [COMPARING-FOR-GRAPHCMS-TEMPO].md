This is the last website I worked in during my time at Code Nation, the Bogota Bulldogs is the first amateur australian football club dedicated to establishing and growing the great australian sport in Bogot√° and across Colombia. I finished the full site and left when it was just about to be launched. (The URL is temporary and will change when the site gets live).
